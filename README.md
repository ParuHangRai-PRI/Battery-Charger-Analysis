# Battery Charging Characteristics of WAS 2.0 project

The project intends to study the charging charaacteristics of the battery in WAS 2.0 project. Battery characteristics is necessary to implement proper Battery Management System (BMS), increase the stability of the system, indicate battery health. 

## Results

I measured charging current, voltage of battery and temperature of battery in the project. Charging of battery was conducted at three C-rate (1C, 0.5C and 0.25C). We have used H18650CQ Li-ion cell with 2550 mAh and 9.18 Wh rating in series in our system.

The charging current, voltages and temperature data were logged to SD Card and analysed, following are the results.
